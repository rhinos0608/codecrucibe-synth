## 📊 TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS

### **Quality Metrics Dimensions**
1. **Cyclomatic Complexity** (25% weight) - Decision point analysis
2. **Maintainability Index** (20% weight) - Microsoft formula implementation
3. **Linting Score** (20% weight) - ESLint issue density scoring
4. **Type Coverage** (15% weight) - TypeScript annotation analysis
5. **Formatting Score** (10% weight) - Prettier compliance assessment
6. **Documentation** (5% weight) - Comment ratio analysis
7. **Code Duplication** (3% weight) - Duplicate line detection
8. **Halstead Complexity** (2% weight) - Operator/operand analysis

### **Algorithm Implementation**
```typescript
// Composite Score Calculation
const compositeScore = 
  complexityScore * weights.cyclomaticComplexity +
  maintainabilityScore * weights.maintainabilityIndex +
  lintingScore * weights.lintingScore +
  formattingScore * weights.formattingScore +
  typeCoverageScore * weights.typeCoverage +
  documentationScore * weights.documentation +
  duplicationScore * weights.duplication +
  halsteadScore * weights.halsteadComplexity;

// Quality Gate Logic
const passed = criticalIssues === 0 && 
               errorIssues <= 2 && 
               enhancedScore >= qualityPassThreshold &&
               objectiveScore >= 60;
```
