# Advanced Coding Techniques with Codex-Inspired Features

## Overview

This guide provides practical advice on how to use CodeCrucible Synth, with its new Codex-inspired features, for advanced coding tasks. By mastering these techniques, you can significantly improve your productivity and code quality.

## 1. Prompt Engineering for Code Generation

### Concept

The quality of the code generated by CodeCrucible Synth is highly dependent on the quality of your prompts. "Prompt engineering" is the art of crafting prompts that produce the best possible results.

### Techniques

*   **Be Specific:** Instead of "create a function," try "create a Python function that takes a list of integers and returns the sum of the even numbers."
*   **Provide Context:** Use the `--context` option or pipe in existing code to give the model more information about your project.
*   **Define the Persona:** Use the `--voice` option to tell the model to act as a specific type of expert (e.g., `--voice security`).
*   **Iterate:** Don't expect a perfect result on the first try. Use the interactive mode (`--interactive`) to refine your prompts and build on the model's previous responses.

### Example

**Bad Prompt:**

```bash
cc "make a web server"
```

**Good Prompt:**

```bash
cc --voice developer --context "I'm using Express.js" \
"Create a simple Express.js server with a single endpoint that returns 'Hello, World!'"
```

## 2. Using CodeCrucible Synth for Debugging

### Concept

CodeCrucible Synth can be a powerful debugging tool. By providing the model with a code snippet and an error message, you can often get a quick and accurate explanation of the problem and a suggested fix.

### Techniques

*   **Pipe in the Error:**

    ```bash
    cat my-buggy-code.js | cc "This code is throwing a 'TypeError: cannot read property 'length' of undefined'. Please explain the error and fix the code."
    ```

*   **Use the `debugger` Voice:** We can create a new `debugger` voice that is specifically trained to analyze and fix bugs.

    **File**: `config/voices/core/debugger.yaml` (new)

    ```yaml
systemPrompt: |
  You are a debugging expert. Analyze the user's code and error message,
  provide a clear explanation of the bug, and offer a corrected code snippet.
 temperature: 0.2 # For more deterministic, less creative responses
    ```

    **Usage:**

    ```bash
    cat my-buggy-code.js | cc --voice debugger "Fix this bug"
    ```

## 3. Leveraging Specialized Voices for Domain-Specific Tasks

### Concept

The "specialized voices" feature, combined with fine-tuning, is what truly sets CodeCrucible Synth apart. By creating and fine-tuning voices for specific domains, you can build a team of AI experts tailored to your needs.

### Example: A `DataScience` Voice

1.  **Create a `datascience` voice:**

    **File**: `config/voices/data/datascience.yaml` (new)

    ```yaml
systemPrompt: |
  You are a data scientist. You are an expert in Python, pandas, NumPy,
  and scikit-learn. Your code should be clean, efficient, and well-documented.
    ```

2.  **Fine-tune a model on your data science projects:**

    ```bash
    cc fine-tune --model codellama:7b --directory ~/data-science-projects --new-model-name datascience-codellama
    ```

3.  **Use the new voice and model:**

    ```bash
    cc --voice datascience --model datascience-codellama "Write a Python script to load a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame and calculate the mean of the 'age' column."
    ```

## 4. Code Refactoring and Modernization

### Concept

CodeCrucible Synth can help you refactor old code to use modern language features and best practices.

### Techniques

*   **Specify the Target:** Be explicit about the desired changes.

    ```bash
    cat old-javascript.js | cc "Refactor this JavaScript code to use ES6 classes and arrow functions."
    ```

*   **Use a `refactor` voice:**

    **File**: `config/voices/core/refactor.yaml` (new)

    ```yaml
systemPrompt: |
  You are a code refactoring expert. Your goal is to improve the structure,
  readability, and performance of the user's code without changing its functionality.
    ```

    **Usage:**

    ```bash
    cat my-class.java | cc --voice refactor "Improve this Java class."
    ```

By mastering these advanced techniques, you can transform CodeCrucible Synth from a simple code completion tool into a powerful, versatile AI partner in your development workflow.
