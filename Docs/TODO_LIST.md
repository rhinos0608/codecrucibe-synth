## 🔧 PHASE 2: TYPESCRIPT & CODE QUALITY IMPROVEMENTS (Week 3-4)
*Status: 🔄 Active Implementation*

### ✅ TypeScript Strictness & Type Safety (IN PROGRESS - SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS)
- [x] **TYPESCRIPT CRITICAL**: Enable strict mode and eliminate `any` types
  - [x] ✅ **DISCOVERED**: 277 total TypeScript compilation errors (systematic fixing in progress)
  - [x] ✅ Enabled `noImplicitAny: true` in tsconfig.json (first step of strict mode)
  - [x] ✅ Fixed 6+ implicit `any` type violations in critical files
  - [ ] 🔄 Continue fixing remaining 24 implicit any errors systematically
  - [ ] 📋 Fix missing module imports throughout codebase (primary error source)
  - [ ] 🔧 Ensure @typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any is enforced as error
  - [ ] **PROGRESS**: 277 errors identified, incremental fixes begun
  - [ ] **TARGET**: Achieve zero TypeScript compilation errors (long-term systematic effort)

### Jest Configuration & Testing Infrastructure  
- [ ] **TESTING CRITICAL**: Fix Jest configuration issues identified by Architecture Agent
  - [ ] Remove `forceExit: true` from jest.config.cjs (indicates async cleanup problems)
  - [ ] Fix underlying async cleanup issues causing open handles
  - [ ] Include index.ts files in test coverage collection (currently excluded)
  - [ ] Re-enable skipped tests (advanced-synthesis.test.ts.skip)
  - [ ] **TARGET**: Robust test infrastructure without forced exits

### Additional Dead Code & Architecture Cleanup
- [ ] **ARCHITECTURE**: Address remaining dead code opportunities
  - [ ] Remove additional stale comments referencing enhanced/simple agents (36 files)
  - [ ] Consolidate duplicate configuration managers if any remain
  - [ ] Clean up unused imports and functions identified during TypeScript fixes
  - [ ] **TARGET**: Further reduce technical debt beyond the 727 lines already removed

### 📊 TypeScript Error Analysis & Systematic Plan
*Based on comprehensive typecheck analysis*

**Error Categories Identified (277 total):**
- 🔴 **Missing Module Imports**: ~60% of errors (primary issue)
- 🟡 **Implicit Any Types**: 24 remaining (6+ already fixed)  
- 🟠 **Property/Method Not Found**: ~25% of errors
- 🔵 **Type Mismatches**: ~10% of errors

**Systematic Fixing Approach:**
1. **Phase 2A**: Complete implicit any fixes (24 remaining → 0)
2. **Phase 2B**: Resolve missing module imports (largest category)
3. **Phase 2C**: Fix property/method not found errors
4. **Phase 2D**: Address type mismatches and enable full strict mode

**Expected Timeline**: 2-3 weeks of systematic daily fixes
