## 🚨 **CRITICAL DEPENDENCIES & BLOCKERS**

### Must Complete First
1. **ModelClient activation** - System won't produce AI responses without this
2. **Legacy cleanup** - "[object Object]" issue blocks proper output  
3. **ES import fixes** - Build failures prevent testing other components

### External Dependencies
- **Ollama models**: Required for AI functionality
- **Smithery API key**: Optional but enables external MCP servers
- **LM Studio**: Optional for hybrid model architecture
- **Node.js 18+**: Required for ES modules and modern TypeScript

### Risk Mitigation
- **Backup strategy**: Keep archive of legacy files before deletion
- **Rollback plan**: Git branches for each major phase
- **Testing plan**: Smoke tests after each major change
- **Performance monitoring**: Watch memory/CPU during activation
