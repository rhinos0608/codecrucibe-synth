# Security Cleanup and Audit Logging

**Locations**:

- `src/infrastructure/security/security-audit-logger.ts`
- `src/infrastructure/security/production-rbac-system.ts`
- `src/infrastructure/monitoring/user-warning-system.ts`

## Summary

Improve security hygiene by centralizing audit logs and ensuring interval-based
processes are properly cleaned up.

## Rationale

Centralized logging supports compliance, and proper interval cleanup prevents
resource leaks in long-running services.

## Tasks

- Integrate with a SIEM or audit database in `SecurityAuditLogger`.
- Ensure all interval timers are tracked and cleared on shutdown.
- Add unit tests verifying cleanup paths.
