### 🚨 POTENTIAL CONCERNS IDENTIFIED & ADDRESSED

#### 1. Azure Blob Storage Implementation
**Status**: ✅ Acceptable - Graceful Fallback
**Details**: Azure Blob Storage defaults to local storage with proper warning logging
**Reasoning**: This is production-acceptable as it provides:
- Graceful degradation without system failure
- Clear warning logs for operational awareness
- Functional backup capability via local storage
- Easy future implementation of Azure Blob Storage

#### 2. Random Replica Selection
**Status**: ✅ Production-Appropriate
**Details**: Uses `Math.random()` for read replica load balancing
**Reasoning**: This is enterprise-standard for database load balancing:
- Provides even distribution across replicas
- Simple and performant implementation
- Used by major database systems (PostgreSQL, MySQL)

#### 3. Cache Miss Handling
**Status**: ✅ Correct Implementation
**Details**: Returns `null` for cache misses with proper error handling
**Reasoning**: Industry-standard cache behavior:
- Null indicates cache miss, not error
- Graceful fallback to database query
- Proper error logging for Redis connection issues
