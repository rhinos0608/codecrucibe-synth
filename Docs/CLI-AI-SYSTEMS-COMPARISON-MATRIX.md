## Communication Patterns Analysis

### OpenAI Codex
**Characteristics:**
- Natural conversational style with detailed explanations
- Context-aware code suggestions and completions
- Interactive approval for sensitive operations
- Code-first approach with explanatory comments

**Example Interaction Pattern:**
```
User: Create a function to validate email addresses
Codex: I'll create an email validation function for you. This function will use regex to check for valid email format and handle common edge cases:

```python
import re

def validate_email(email):
    pattern = r'^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$'
    return re.match(pattern, email) is not None
```

This function checks for proper email format including domain validation.
```

### Claude Code  
**Characteristics:**
- Ultra-concise responses with minimal explanation
- Direct answers prioritized over educational content
- Tool-heavy approach with extensive MCP integration
- Security-first mindset with defensive task limitations

**Example Interaction Pattern:**
```
User: Create a function to validate email addresses
Claude Code: ```python
import re
def validate_email(email):
    return re.match(r'^[^@]+@[^@]+\.[^@]+$', email) is not None
```
```

### Gemini CLI
**Characteristics:**
- Adaptive response length based on query complexity
- Context-aware tool selection and execution
- Performance-optimized with intelligent caching
- Enterprise integration capabilities

**Example Interaction Pattern:**
```
User: Create a function to validate email addresses
Gemini CLI: Here's an efficient email validation function:

```python
import re
def validate_email(email):
    return bool(re.match(r"[^@]+@[^@]+\.[^@]+", email))
```

Uses regex for fast validation. Need additional validation features?
```
