- **CLI Interface**: All basic commands working (status, models, help)
- **Configuration**: System properly loading user configuration

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Performance Issues Identified:**
- **High Memory Usage**: 91%+ memory consumption during AI model inference
- **Slow Response Times**: 15-18 second latencies for complex analysis
- **LM Studio Connection**: Intermittent failures during execution (despite showing available)
- **Model Context**: AI responses indicating limited project context access

#### üîß **Additional Fixes Applied:**

1. **Memory Threshold Optimization** - `src/core/performance/active-process-manager.ts:55-61`
   - **Issue**: Memory emergency threshold too high (95%)
   - **Fix**: Lowered thresholds for proactive model switching:
     - Memory Warning: 75% ‚Üí 70%
     - Memory Critical: 85% ‚Üí 80% 
     - Memory Emergency: 95% ‚Üí 90%
   - **Impact**: Earlier intervention to prevent system instability

2. **Automatic Model Switching Verification**
   - Confirmed emergency memory handling is implemented
   - System will automatically switch to smaller models under memory pressure
   - Garbage collection triggers available for resource cleanup

#### üìä **Runtime Performance Metrics:**

- **Model Selection**: gemma:2b auto-selected for optimal performance
- **Memory Baseline**: ~70% before inference, 91%+ during inference
- **Response Quality**: Multi-voice synthesis working but with limited context

#### üö® **Remaining Issues for Future Development:**
1. **Project Context Access**: Models need better access to actual codebase content
2. **LM Studio Stability**: Connection reliability needs improvement
3. **Memory Optimization**: Large model inference consuming excessive memory
4. **Response Latency**: 15+ second response times need optimization
