# MCP Server Research Findings

**Date:** August 22, 2025  
**Research Objective:** Analyze and document three target MCP servers for integration into CodeCrucible Synth  
**Target Servers:** Terminal Controller, Task Manager, Remote Shell Server  

## Executive Summary

Research conducted on three Smithery.ai MCP servers reveals comprehensive capabilities for terminal control, task management, and remote shell operations. These servers provide 15+ standardized tools that can significantly enhance CodeCrucible's autonomous capabilities while maintaining security through the Model Context Protocol.

## Current MCP Implementation Status

### Existing Implementation
- **Built-in MCP-like functionality** with 5 basic servers (filesystem, git, terminal, packageManager, smithery)
- **Local tool execution** without actual MCP protocol compliance
- **Basic security validation** with path restrictions and command filtering
- **No external MCP server connectivity** - all operations are internal

### Limitations Identified
1. **No Protocol Compliance:** Current system mimics MCP but doesn't use actual MCP transport
2. **Limited Capabilities:** Basic tools compared to specialized MCP servers
3. **No Remote Execution:** All operations are local only
4. **Missing Task Management:** No structured task queue or workflow management
5. **Isolation:** Cannot leverage the broader MCP ecosystem
