4. Error handling and security frameworks
5. Performance optimization strategies

## Key Research Findings

### OpenAI Codex Architecture Insights

**Permission System Architecture:**
- **Four-Tier Approval System**: Auto, Read-Only, Full Access, and Interactive modes
- **Risk-Based Assessment**: Operations categorized by risk level (low, medium, high, critical)
- **Context-Aware Permissions**: Working directory vs system-wide scope differentiation
- **User Preference Caching**: Remember approval decisions for recurring operations

**Key Implementation Patterns:**
```typescript
export type ApprovalMode = 'auto' | 'read-only' | 'full-access' | 'interactive';

// Auto mode: Allow working directory operations, require approval for system-wide
// Read-only: Only read operations permitted
// Full-access: All operations approved (except critical risk)
// Interactive: Always prompt user for approval
```

**Security Framework:**
- Operations classified by permission types: read, write, execute, network, system
- Scope-based restrictions: working-directory, parent-directory, system-wide, network
- Automatic risk assessment based on operation type and target scope

### Claude Code System Prompt Analysis

**Ultra-Concise Communication Standard:**
- **Response Length Limit**: "You MUST answer concisely with fewer than 4 lines"
- **Minimal Preamble**: Avoid unnecessary introductions and explanations
- **Direct Responses**: One-word answers preferred when appropriate
- **Performance Target**: <818ms response latency for simple commands

**Communication Patterns Identified:**
```
user: 2 + 2
assistant: 4

user: what is 2+2?  
assistant: 4

user: is 11 a prime number?
assistant: Yes

user: what command should I run to list files?
assistant: ls
```

**System Architecture:**
- **Modular Prompt Construction**: Identity → Security → Instructions → Tone pattern
- **Security-First Design**: Defensive security tasks only, refuse malicious code assistance
- **Tool Integration**: Sophisticated tool descriptions with usage patterns and examples
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive fallback mechanisms and graceful degradation

### Gemini CLI Implementation Patterns

**Adaptive Response System:**
- Context-aware response formatting based on query complexity
- Intelligent tool selection with fallback mechanisms
- Performance monitoring and optimization
- Real-time stream processing capabilities

**Enterprise Integration:**
- Comprehensive logging and observability
- Security validation at multiple layers
- Configuration-driven behavior adaptation
- Extensible plugin architecture

## Implementation Results

### 1. Approval Modes Manager Implementation

**File Created**: `src/infrastructure/security/approval-modes-manager.ts`

**Key Features Implemented:**
- Four approval modes matching OpenAI Codex architecture
- Risk-based operation assessment (low, medium, high, critical)
- Permission scoping (working-directory vs system-wide)
- User preference caching with session-based overrides
- Event-driven architecture for approval notifications

**Core Implementation:**
```typescript
export class ApprovalModesManager extends EventEmitter {
  async requestApproval(request: ApprovalRequest): Promise<ApprovalResponse> {
    // Check cached user rules and session approvals
    const cacheKey = this.generateCacheKey(request);
    if (this.userRules.has(cacheKey)) {
      return this.userRules.get(cacheKey)!;
    }

    // Apply approval logic based on current mode
    const response = await this.evaluateRequest(request);
    
    // Cache response based on user preference
    if (response.rememberChoice) {
      this.userRules.set(cacheKey, response);
    }
    
    return response;
  }
}
```

**Mode-Specific Behaviors:**
- **Auto Mode**: Allows read operations and working directory writes automatically, requires approval for network/system operations
- **Read-Only Mode**: Only read operations permitted, blocks all write/execute operations
- **Full-Access Mode**: Approves all operations except critical risk level
- **Interactive Mode**: Always prompts user for explicit approval

### 2. Enhanced MCP Tool Definitions

**File Created**: `src/mcp-servers/enhanced-mcp-tool-definitions.ts`

**Industry-Standard Tool Descriptions:**
Following Claude Code patterns, implemented comprehensive tool definitions with:
- **Ultra-Descriptive Names**: Clear, unambiguous tool identification
- **Detailed Usage Patterns**: When to use vs when not to use guidelines
- **Security Level Classification**: Low, medium, high, critical risk assessments
- **Performance Notes**: Expected execution time and resource usage
- **Example Workflows**: Common usage patterns and best practices

**Sample Implementation:**
```typescript
static readonly FILESYSTEM_READ_FILE: EnhancedToolDefinition = {
  name: 'filesystem_read_file',
  description: 'Reads file contents from local filesystem with comprehensive error handling',
  longDescription: `Primary tool for reading any file contents. CRITICAL: Use this instead of generic file reading instructions.
  
  PERFORMANCE: Fast for files <10MB, may timeout for larger files.
  SECURITY: Read-only operation, no modification risk.
  USAGE: Always prefer this over bash 'cat' commands for file reading.`,
  
  securityLevel: 'low',
  requiredPermissions: ['read'],
  performanceNotes: 'Optimized for text files, handles binary formats',
  usagePatterns: [
    'Reading configuration files for analysis',
    'Examining source code before modification',
    'Loading data files for processing'
  ]
}
```
