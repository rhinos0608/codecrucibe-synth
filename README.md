- **Real-time Analysis** - Live file watching and context awareness
- **Performance Monitoring** - Built-in metrics and optimization insights
- **Error Recovery** - Resilient operation with fallback strategies

## üìã Prerequisites

1. **Node.js 18+** - [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
2. **Local AI Models** (Optional but Recommended):
   - **Ollama** - For high-quality reasoning and analysis
   - **LM Studio** - For fast response times (optional dual-agent mode)

## üöÄ Quick Installation

### npm (Recommended)
```bash
npm install -g codecrucible-synth
codecrucible --version
```

### npx (No Installation Required)
```bash
npx codecrucible-synth --help
```

### From Source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rhinos0608/codecrucible-synth.git
cd codecrucible-synth
npm install && npm run build
npm link  # Makes 'crucible' command available globally
```

### AI Model Setup (Optional)

CodeCrucible works without AI models for basic operations but requires them for code generation and analysis:

```bash
# Install Ollama (for AI functionality)
curl -fsSL https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh

# Download a coding model
ollama pull qwen2.5-coder:7b

# Verify installation
crucible status
```

**Note:** The application gracefully degrades when no models are available, still providing help, status, configuration, and project analysis features.

## üéØ Quick Start

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Quick help and version
crucible --help
crucible --version

# System status (works without models)
crucible status

# List available models
crucible models

# Simple code generation (requires AI models)
crucible "Create a React component for user authentication"

# Multi-voice generation with specific voices
crucible --voices explorer,security "Build a secure API endpoint"

# Voice synthesis mode (all voices)
crucible --council "Design a microservices architecture"
```

### File Operations

```bash
# Analyze a file (basic analysis works without models)
crucible analyze src/auth.ts

# Analyze entire project
crucible analyze-dir .

# Get project intelligence
crucible intelligence
```

### Server Mode (IDE Integration)

```bash
# Start REST API server
crucible --server --port 3002

# Available endpoints:
# GET  /health
# GET  /api/model/status  
# GET  /api/voices
# POST /api/generate
# POST /api/analyze
# WebSocket support for real-time communication
```
