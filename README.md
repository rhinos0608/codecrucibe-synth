- **Performance Monitoring** - Built-in metrics and optimization insights
- **Error Recovery** - Resilient operation with fallback strategies

## üìã Prerequisites

1. **Node.js 18+** - [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
2. **Local AI Models** (Optional but Recommended):
   - **Ollama** - For high-quality reasoning and analysis
   - **LM Studio** - For fast response times (optional dual-agent mode)

## üöÄ Quick Installation

### npm Global Installation (Recommended)
```bash
# Install globally for instant access
npm install -g codecrucible-synth

# Verify installation with multiple commands
crucible --version
cc --version
codecrucible --version
```

### npx (No Installation Required)
```bash
# Use without installing
npx codecrucible-synth --help
npx codecrucible-synth status
```

### From Source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rhinos0608/codecrucible-synth.git
cd codecrucible-synth
npm install && npm run build
npm link  # Makes 'crucible' command available globally
```

### AI Model Setup (Optional)

CodeCrucible works without AI models for basic operations but requires them for code generation and analysis:

```bash
# Install Ollama (for AI functionality)
curl -fsSL https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh

# Download a coding model
ollama pull qwen2.5-coder:7b

# Verify installation
crucible status
```

**Note:** The application gracefully degrades when no models are available, still providing help, status, configuration, and project analysis features.

  - Usage: Automatically used when you need external information or research
  - Example: `cc "How to implement OAuth 2.0 in Node.js"` (will search for current best practices)

- **Hugging Face Integration**: AI model recommendations and suggestions
  - Purpose: Discover and suggest AI models suitable for specific tasks
  - Usage: When working on ML/AI projects, suggests appropriate models from Hugging Face Hub
  - Example: `cc "I need a text classification model"` (will recommend suitable models)

- **Documentation Search (ref-tools)**: Search programming documentation and guides  
  - Purpose: Find relevant documentation for libraries, frameworks, and programming concepts
  - Usage: Automatically searches documentation when you need technical references
