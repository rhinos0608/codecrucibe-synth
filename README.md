## 🚀 Quick Installation

### npm Global Installation (Recommended)
```bash
# Install globally for instant access
npm install -g codecrucible-synth

# Verify installation with multiple commands
crucible --version
cc --version
codecrucible --version
```

### npx (No Installation Required)
```bash
# Use without installing
npx codecrucible-synth --help
npx codecrucible-synth status
```

### From Source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rhinos0608/codecrucible-synth.git
cd codecrucible-synth
npm install && npm run build
npm link  # Makes 'crucible' command available globally
```

### Environment Configuration

CodeCrucible uses a comprehensive typed configuration system with automatic validation. Create your environment configuration:

```bash
# Copy the environment template
cp .env.example .env

# Edit the file with your preferred editor
nano .env  # or code .env, vim .env, etc.
```

#### Key Configuration Categories

**API Keys & External Services:**
```bash
# Smithery registry for external MCP servers
SMITHERY_API_KEY=your_smithery_api_key_here

# E2B for secure code execution
E2B_API_KEY=your_e2b_api_key_here

# MCP server integrations
MCP_TERMINAL_API_KEY=your_terminal_controller_api_key_here
MCP_TASK_MANAGER_API_KEY=your_task_manager_api_key_here
```

**AI Provider Configuration:**
```bash
# Local AI endpoints (customize if different from defaults)
OLLAMA_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:11434
LM_STUDIO_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:1234

# Model behavior
MODEL_MAX_TOKENS=3000      # Range: 1-32768
MODEL_TEMPERATURE=0.7      # Range: 0.0-2.0
```

**Performance & Timeouts:**
```bash
# Request timeouts (in milliseconds)
REQUEST_TIMEOUT=30000           # 30 seconds
OLLAMA_TIMEOUT=110000          # 110 seconds
TOOL_EXECUTION_TIMEOUT=30000   # 30 seconds

# Performance limits
MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS=10     # Range: 1-100
RESPONSE_CACHE_SIZE=100        # Cache size
MEMORY_WARNING_THRESHOLD=512   # MB
```

**Security & Environment:**
```bash
# Environment and security
NODE_ENV=development           # development|test|production
LOG_LEVEL=info                # trace|debug|info|warn|error
STRICT_MODE=true              # Recommended: true
VALIDATE_INPUTS=true          # Recommended: true
```

#### Configuration Validation

The configuration system provides automatic validation with clear error messages:

- **Type Safety**: All values are validated and coerced to correct types
- **Range Validation**: Numeric values are checked against valid ranges
- **URL Validation**: Endpoints are validated as proper URLs
- **Environment-Specific Rules**: Production requires stricter security settings
- **Port Conflict Detection**: Prevents server port conflicts

```bash
# Test your configuration
crucible status
```

#### Minimal vs Full Setup

**Minimal Setup** (basic functionality):
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# No additional configuration needed
```

**Recommended Setup** (full features):
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Add Smithery API key for external MCP servers
# Configure AI endpoints if using non-default ports
```

**Production Setup**:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Set NODE_ENV=production
# Configure all security settings
# Add required API keys
```

### AI Model Setup (Optional)

CodeCrucible works without AI models for basic operations but requires them for code generation and analysis:

```bash
# Install Ollama (for AI functionality)
curl -fsSL https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh

# Download a coding model
ollama pull qwen2.5-coder:7b

# Verify installation
crucible status
```

**Note:** The application gracefully degrades when no models are available, still providing help, status, configuration, and project analysis features.
