## 💡 Example Interactions

### Complex Task Planning
```
🧠 > "Refactor the user authentication system to use JWT tokens"

🎯 Processing: Refactor the user authentication system to use JWT tokens

Agent Planning:
1. Analyze current authentication implementation
2. Identify areas requiring JWT integration
3. Install necessary JWT libraries
4. Create JWT utility functions
5. Update authentication middleware
6. Modify login/logout endpoints
7. Update tests to reflect changes
8. Generate documentation

Executing plan...
✅ Analysis complete: Found 3 auth files requiring updates
✅ JWT utilities created: jwt-utils.ts
✅ Middleware updated: auth-middleware.ts
✅ Endpoints refactored: auth-routes.ts
✅ Tests updated: 15 test cases added
✅ Documentation generated: JWT-AUTH.md

🤖 Agent Response:
Successfully refactored authentication system to use JWT tokens. Key changes:
- Created JWT utility functions with proper error handling
- Updated authentication middleware for token validation
- Refactored login endpoint to return JWT tokens
- Added refresh token functionality
- Updated all tests with new authentication flow
- Generated comprehensive documentation

The system now supports secure JWT-based authentication with proper token lifecycle management.
```

### Advanced Code Analysis
```
🧠 > "Analyze the performance bottlenecks in the data processing module"

🤖 Agent Response:
Analysis of data-processor.ts reveals several performance issues:

**High-Impact Issues:**
1. Line 45: Nested loop with O(n²) complexity in processUserData()
2. Line 78: Synchronous file I/O blocking event loop
3. Line 112: Memory leak in event listener registration

**Optimization Suggestions:**
- Replace nested loop with Map-based lookup (90% performance improvement)
- Use asynchronous file operations with streaming
- Implement proper cleanup in event handlers

**Code Quality:**
- Complexity Score: 15/10 (high)
- 3 functions exceed 50 lines
- Missing error handling in 2 critical paths

Generated optimized version in data-processor-optimized.ts with:
- 300% performance improvement
- Reduced memory usage by 60%
- Added comprehensive error handling
```
