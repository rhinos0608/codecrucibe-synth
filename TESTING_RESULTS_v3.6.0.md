- **Note**: Requires architectural fix for proper voice selection

#### 3. Autonomous Agent Mode
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Working (Optimized)
- **Performance**: 13s latency (improved from 15-30s)
- **Optimization**: Sequential processing vs concurrent requests
- **Quality**: Comprehensive responses with task planning

#### 4. Performance Benchmarking
- **Models Tested**: 7 models from 2B to 32B parameters
- **GPU Utilization**: RTX 4070 SUPER actively used
- **Memory Usage**: Optimized to <85% threshold
- **Latency**: Significant improvements across all modes

#### 5. Server Mode API
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Functional
- **Note**: Port conflicts detected (3001 occupied)
- **Features**: REST endpoints and WebSocket support available
- **Integration**: Ready for IDE extensions

#### 6. File Analysis Capabilities
- **Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Blocked by Security
- **Issue**: Input validation too aggressive
- **Workaround**: Direct mode bypasses some restrictions
- **Quality**: Analysis quality good when not blocked

## üöÄ Performance Optimizations Implemented

### GPU Configuration Optimizations
```yaml
gpu:
  layers: 8           # Reduced from 10
  batch_size: 128     # Reduced from 256

  num_gpu: 8          # Optimized GPU allocation
```

### Concurrency Optimizations
```yaml
voices:
  parallel: false      # Sequential processing
  maxConcurrent: 1     # Single request mode

performance:
  voiceParallelism:
    maxConcurrent: 1   # No parallel voice processing
    batchSize: 1       # One voice at a time
```
