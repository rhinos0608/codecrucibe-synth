# Development Mode Deployment Configuration

## Production Deployment Status: ACTIVE ‚úÖ
Dev mode has been disabled for ProductLaunch deployment while preserving all code for future activation.

## Quick Re-activation Guide

### Backend Dev Mode
To re-enable server-side dev mode features:
1. Set environment variable: `FORCE_PRODUCTION_MODE=false`
2. Restart the server
3. All unlimited generation features will be restored

### Frontend Dev Mode  
To re-enable client-side dev mode features:
1. Set environment variable: `VITE_FORCE_PRODUCTION_MODE=false`
2. Rebuild the frontend
3. All dev UI badges and extended logging will be restored

## Features Disabled for Production

- ‚ùå Unlimited AI generations
- ‚ùå Unlimited voice combinations  
- ‚ùå Rate limit bypass
- ‚ùå Extended prompt length (15,000 chars)

## Code Preservation

All development mode code remains intact and functional:
- Detection logic preserved in both files
- Feature flags maintained
- Environment variable detection retained
- Only the initial detection is overridden for production

## Monitoring

The application will log "forced_production_mode_for_deployment" as the reason when dev mode detection runs, confirming the override is active.

## Rollback Process

To completely restore dev mode behavior:
1. Remove or set `FORCE_PRODUCTION_MODE=false` 
2. Remove or set `VITE_FORCE_PRODUCTION_MODE=false`
3. Restart both server and rebuild frontend
4. All dev mode features will be automatically restored
