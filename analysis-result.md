## Code Analysis: test-sample.js

**1. Brief Summary:**

This code defines two functions and a class:

- `calculateSum` function checks if its arguments are numbers and throws an error if not. 


- `Calculator` class has a history of operations and provides methods for addition, multiplication, and retrieving the history.


**2. Key Functions/Classes/Components:**

- `calculateSum` function: Calculates the sum of two numbers. 


- `Calculator` class: Represents a calculator object with a history of operations.


**3. Code Quality Assessment:**

- Well-organized and readable code.
- Clear and concise comments.
- Consistent naming conventions.
- Effective error handling with custom error message.


**4. Potential Issues or Improvements:**

- The code could be improved by adding input validation for the `calculateSum` function to handle non-numeric values gracefully.
- The history object in the Calculator class could be made immutable to prevent accidental modification.


**5. Security Concerns:**

The code does not contain any security-related concerns. However, if sensitive data were to be stored or processed in the Calculator class, appropriate security measures would be necessary.
