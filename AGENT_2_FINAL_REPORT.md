## üß™ Validation Phase Results

### Current System Analysis

**‚úÖ Strengths Identified**:
- System bootstrap: ~100ms (excellent performance)
- MCP integration: 21 tools operational (13 local + 8 external)
- Domain-aware selection: 98% confidence, intelligent tool filtering

- Multi-voice collaboration: 10 specialized archetypes

**‚ùå Critical Gaps Found**:
- **Performance**: 34+ second execution times (need <10s target)
- **Sequential Processing**: No parallel step execution
- **Context Limitations**: Not utilizing 64K+ token windows
- **Multi-File Coordination**: Missing Cursor-style Composer functionality
- **Streaming**: Batch processing without progressive feedback

|---------|-------------------|-------------------|-----------|
| Task Decomposition | Architect/Editor pattern | Basic collapse phase | **MEDIUM** |
| Multi-File Orchestration | Composer coordination | Single-file focus | **MAJOR** |
| Context Window | 64K+ tokens | Limited context | **MEDIUM** |
| Performance | Sub-10s execution | 34+ seconds | **CRITICAL** |
| Streaming Progress | Real-time updates | Batch only | **MEDIUM** |
| Parallel Processing | Concurrent steps | Sequential only | **MAJOR** |
