Step 4.2: Matrix Team Consciousness Features
Implement advanced team chat capabilities:

AI Council in Chat

Team members can invoke AI council in Matrix rooms
Each archetype appears as distinct Matrix user
Real-time synthesis happens in chat threads
Team decisions tracked and archived


Consciousness Development Tracking

Team spiral phase tracking in Matrix
Group archetypal balance monitoring
Collective shadow work facilitation
Team learning pattern recognition


Living Documentation

Auto-generated docs from Matrix conversations
Code evolution narrative tracking
Decision rationale preservation
Pattern recognition across teams



Step 4.3: Recursive Self-Modification System
Implement system that improves itself:
typescript// Create: src/lib/self-modification.ts
export class SelfModificationEngine {
  async analyzeSustemPerformance(): Promise<PerformanceAnalysis>
  async identifyImproventOpportunities(): Promise<ImprovementSuggestions>
  async implementSystemUpgrades(): Promise<UpgradeResults>
  async validateModifications(): Promise<ValidationResults>
}

Validation Protocol
After each phase, run:
bashnpm run build && npm run test && npm run lint
npm run consciousness:validate  # Custom validation
npm run matrix:test            # Matrix integration tests
npm run synthesis:verify       # Synthesis engine tests
Success Criteria:
