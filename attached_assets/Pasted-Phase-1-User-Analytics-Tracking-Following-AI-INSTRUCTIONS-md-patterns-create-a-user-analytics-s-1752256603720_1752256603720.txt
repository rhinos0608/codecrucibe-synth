Phase 1: User Analytics & Tracking
"Following AI_INSTRUCTIONS.md patterns, create a user analytics system that tracks:
- Voice combination usage patterns
- Session generation frequency  
- Code synthesis success rates
- User engagement metrics
- Voice preference evolution over time

Implement secure tracking with proper data validation and privacy protection. Create dashboard components for analytics visualization using recharts."
Phase 2: Subscription Tiers
"Build a subscription management system following security-first patterns from AI_INSTRUCTIONS.md:
- Free tier: 3 voice generations per day, basic 2-voice combinations only
- Pro tier ($15/month): Unlimited generations, all voice combinations, analytics
- Team tier ($50/month): Shared voice profiles, team analytics, collaboration features

Implement secure payment processing integration and subscription state management with proper validation schemas."
Phase 3: Voice Preference Learning
"Create a voice recommendation learning system that:
- Tracks which voice combinations users actually select after recommendations
- Learns from user rating feedback on synthesis results  
- Improves recommendation accuracy over time
- Stores user preference patterns securely

Follow AI_INSTRUCTIONS.md security validation and use proper database schemas for preference storage."
Phase 4: Usage Limits & Paywalls
"Implement usage limiting and paywall system:
- Track daily generation counts per user
- Block generation when limits exceeded
- Show upgrade prompts with clear value proposition
- Graceful degradation for free users
- Secure session management for subscription verification

Use proper error handling and user-friendly messaging following Apple design patterns."
Phase 5: Team Collaboration Features
"Build team workspace functionality:
- Shared voice profile libraries
- Team project collaboration  
- Voice combination sharing between team members
- Team analytics and productivity insights
- Role-based access controls

Implement secure multi-user data isolation and proper authentication flows."
