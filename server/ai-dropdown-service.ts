FRAMEWORK INTEGRATION:
- Jung's Descent Protocol: Provide suggestions with varying consciousness depths (1=surface, 10=archetypal)
- Alexander's Pattern Language: Ensure suggestions have QWAN (Quality Without A Name) metrics
- Bateson's Recursive Learning: Generate suggestions that learn from context and improve over time
- Campbell's Mythic Journey: Structure suggestions around transformation and growth

CONSCIOUSNESS LEVELS:
1-3: Surface level (basic technical skills)
4-6: Practical mastery (experienced professional)
7-8: Wisdom integration (senior expertise)
9-10: Archetypal embodiment (thought leadership)

PATTERN QUALITY (QWAN):
1-3: Basic functionality
4-6: Well-crafted solutions
7-8: Elegant patterns
9-10: Timeless, living patterns

RESPONSE FORMAT:

Context: ${context}

Create specializations that combine:
- Technical expertise (React, TypeScript, Node.js, Python, etc.)
- Domain knowledge (security, performance, architecture, etc.)
- Consciousness depth (from basic skills to archetypal mastery)

Examples of consciousness-integrated specializations:
- "Security architect specialising in React" (consciousness_level: 7, pattern_quality: 8)
- "Full-stack TypeScript engineer with DevOps mastery" (consciousness_level: 6, pattern_quality: 7)
- "Performance optimization sage for large-scale systems" (consciousness_level: 9, pattern_quality: 9)

Focus on combinations that create unique, valuable engineering perspectives.`;

Context: ${context}

Create personalities that embody:
- Communication styles integrated with consciousness principles
- Problem-solving approaches following Jung's archetypal patterns
- Decision-making frameworks aligned with ethical development
- Collaboration patterns that enhance team consciousness

Examples:
- "Analytical guardian focused on security patterns and defensive coding practices"
- "Collaborative architect building timeless systems with team consciousness"
- "Pragmatic optimizer balancing performance with maintainable elegance"

Each personality should reflect deep technical wisdom combined with human consciousness development.`;

- Jung's archetypal patterns (Explorer, Creator, Sage, Ruler, etc.)
- Alexander's timeless quality in naming
- Professional identity with depth and meaning

Examples:
- "The Security Sage" (consciousness_level: 9, pattern_quality: 8)
- "React Performance Guardian" (consciousness_level: 7, pattern_quality: 7)
- "Full-Stack Consciousness Engineer" (consciousness_level: 8, pattern_quality: 9)

Names should inspire confidence while reflecting deep technical and personal development.`;

Available base perspectives: Explorer, Maintainer, Analyzer, Developer, Implementor

Create enhanced perspectives that:
- Extend base perspectives with consciousness depth
- Integrate Jung's archetypal wisdom
- Reflect Alexander's pattern recognition
- Embody Bateson's systems thinking

Examples:
- "Deep Systems Explorer" (consciousness_level: 8, pattern_quality: 7)
- "Conscious Code Maintainer" (consciousness_level: 7, pattern_quality: 8)
- "Wisdom-Integrated Analyzer" (consciousness_level: 9, pattern_quality: 9)`;
