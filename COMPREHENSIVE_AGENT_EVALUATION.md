- LM Studio not running with API server enabled
- Incorrect endpoint configuration (localhost:1234)
- Model not loaded in LM Studio
- API compatibility issues

**Evidence**:
```log
ERROR LM Studio request failed: read ECONNRESET
ERROR Request failed with status code 404
```

### 2. Model Management Complexity

**Problem**: Large model (codellama:34b) fails to load properly
**Root Causes**:
- VRAM limitations despite 12GB available
- Model corruption or compatibility issues
- Complex optimization requirements

**Evidence**:
```log
ERROR Ollama server error. The model 'codellama:34b' may be corrupted, incompatible, or too large.
WARN Model codellama:34b may still exceed VRAM limits even with optimizations
```

### 3. Performance Optimization Needed

**Problem**: Slow response times for production use
**Root Causes**:
- Large model loading overhead
- Complex initialization processes
- Inefficient streaming implementation
