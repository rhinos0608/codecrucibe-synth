## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Highlights

### Task Classification Engine
Automatically categorizes tasks by:
- **Type**: template, format, analysis, planning, debugging, multi-file
- **Complexity**: simple, medium, complex (scored 0-10+)
- **Context Size**: number of files and prompt length
- **Keywords**: security, performance, architecture indicators

### Routing Rules Engine
Extensible rule-based system:
```yaml
- condition: "taskType == 'template'"
  target: "lmstudio"
  confidence: 0.9
  description: "Templates are fast tasks best handled by LM Studio"

- condition: "complexity == 'complex'"
  target: "ollama" 
  confidence: 0.95
  description: "Complex tasks require Ollama's reasoning capabilities"
```

### Performance Monitoring
Real-time tracking of:
- Response times and success rates per provider
- Escalation frequency and accuracy
- Resource utilization (VRAM, RAM, CPU)
- User satisfaction and quality metrics

## üîß Configuration Examples

### High-End System Configuration
```yaml
hybrid:
  lmStudio:
    maxConcurrent: 4
    models: ["codellama-13b-instruct", "qwen2.5-coder-7b"]
  ollama:
    maxConcurrent: 2  
    models: ["codellama:34b", "qwen2.5:72b"]
  routing:
    escalationThreshold: 0.6  # More aggressive escalation
```

### Resource-Constrained Configuration
```yaml
hybrid:
  lmStudio:
    maxConcurrent: 1
    models: ["gemma-2b-it"]
  ollama:
    maxConcurrent: 1
    models: ["codellama:7b"]
  routing:
    escalationThreshold: 0.8  # Conservative escalation
```

## üìä Usage Examples

### Fast Template Generation
```bash
# Automatically routed to LM Studio for speed
codecrucible --fast "create a React login component"
# Response time: ~0.8s
```

### Complex Analysis  
```bash
# Automatically routed to Ollama for quality
codecrucible "analyze this codebase for security vulnerabilities"
# Response time: ~43s with comprehensive analysis
```

### Hybrid Routing
